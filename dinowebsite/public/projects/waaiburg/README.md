# De Waaiburg App

The De Waaiburg App project aimed to expand an existing app. Upon evaluating the original app, we identified suboptimal code and vulnerabilities, leading us to start from scratch. The project involved developing an app with an open section containing information about De Waaiburg, an organization for Special Youth Care. Additionally, we planned to create a closed section for tracking a client's journey within De Waaiburg.

## App Development

With limited prior experience in Laravel and Flutter, we embarked on this project as an opportunity to learn and grow. We chose Flutter as the framework for the main app, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience across different platforms. For the web app, we explored Laravel 9, developing the necessary skills to build an interactive and comprehensive online platform.

## Open Section: Information about De Waaiburg

The open section of the app provides users with valuable information about De Waaiburg, an organization dedicated to Special Youth Care. This includes details about the organization's mission, vision, services offered, and contact information. Users can easily navigate through the app to explore various aspects of De Waaiburg and gain a comprehensive understanding of its operations.

## Closed Section: Work in Progress

The closed section of the app, dedicated to tracking a client's journey within De Waaiburg, is currently under development and scheduled for implementation in the next semester. This section will feature a unique component called "Leefboom" (Tree of Life), where clients can engage in self-reflection by answering open-ended questions. As they progress and resolve these questions, a virtual tree will grow, symbolizing their personal growth and achievements. Once the tree is fully grown, clients will have the opportunity to review and reflect on their trajectory within De Waaiburg, fostering valuable insights and experiences.

## Conclusion

The De Waaiburg App project provided us with an invaluable learning experience. Despite having limited prior knowledge of Laravel and Flutter, we embraced the challenge and acquired new skills throughout the development process. While the closed section of the app is still a work in progress, we are excited about its potential to enhance the client experience within De Waaiburg.
